GameTracker
 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
This project is one of my coursework. It includes a Java class named GameTracker that manages a collection of Game objects.
Each game has a unique ID, a title, a genre (like RPG or Action...), and a status (like Completed, In progress or Not started).
The GameTracker class allows you to add, remove, update, filter and list the games.
It also allow you to export the games in the collection to a CSV file.

VERSION or DATE:

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
-Create a GameTracker object on the Object Bench in BlueJ.
-Call the populate() method to add some sample games.
-Use the other method like addGame(), removeGame()... to test all the features.
